# AnimePedia

Recently the Anime industy is booming all over the world, and specially in India, in a couple of years it has grown so much. So keeping that in mind, for our fellow Anime Lovers this is an app which is basically an Encyclopedia for most of the Anime Series that has been released till date. Users can signup and on our homepage, can access a huge collection of top rated animes, click on any one you like to get information about that particular anime, for ex : Title, Release date, End date, ongoing or ended, a brief synopsis of the plot of the anime, rating of the anime etc. Users can also search their favourite Anime and read about it, in the search section.

This project is currently ongoing, many more features are to be added, if you are also an Anime lover or not, don't hesitate to come up and share some ideas for the app that you would like to see, it will be much appreciated. 

### Tech Stack Used : 

- **Flutter & Dart**
- **Firebase**

**Flutter** is light weight, easy to implement and fast, thats why Flutter has been my choice to develop this application. 

### Features to be added : 
- User SignUp and LogIn 
- User favourite section to store your favourite anime to watch later
- share and suggest anime to your friends

If people like it we may even be able to create an Anime streaming service which is in high need right now in our society for all our fellow anime lovers cause as an Anime lover myself I know how hard it is to watch anime on third party websites with ads. So be free to let me know your thoughts, we can even collab to make it possible.
